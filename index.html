    Hello! I'm Sydney Gibson. I am a security engineering manager at Google, where I lead efforts to secure products that use AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I led an engineering team that built and deployed
    <a
      href="https://www.rivosinc.com/resources/blog/rivos-collaborates-to-complete-secure-provisioning-of-integrated-opentitan-root-of-trust-during-soc-production">
      secure manufacturing systems</a>
    for open source–based, high-performance AI chips. I also
    <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/zerorisc-gets-10-million-funding-says-open-source-silicon-security-inevitable/">
      helped raise $10 million</a>
    in funding. Earlier in my career,
    I worked as a software engineer at Aurora, where I did a wide range of work leading up to the
    launch of the first
    <a

      driverless long-haul truck</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spent time in academia as a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University and as a
    researcher at Google.
    During this time, I formally verified cryptographic security routines for
    <a href="https://opentitan.org/">OpenTitan</a>, which became the first 
    <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/02/fabrication-begins-for-production-opentitan-silicon.html">
       commercial open silicon</a>
    chip. I was also a member of the
    <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">Everest Project</a>, where I contributed to multiple verification
    frameworks that came out of the project.
    I received a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship in 2020, and left my program in 2022.
    </p>

  <p>
    I received my B.S. and
  <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/gibsons-meng.pdf"> M.Eng.</a>  
  from MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department. While there, I
    worked with the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/">Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems</a> group.
